# Pandas-mini-project
This repository contains a practice project showcasing data manipulation and analysis using the popular Python library Pandas.
Step 1: Load the data
 ● Youreceive a CSV file named makeSenseOfCensus.csv containing the census data. Your job is to
 load this data into a NumPy array for analysis.
 ● Tounderstand what the data looks like, print the entire dataset.
 ● Checkthetype of the data structure you've loaded to ensure it's a NumPy array.
 Step 2: Append the Data
 Scenario: A new record has come in, and you need to update your dataset to include this new
 information.
 ● Youreceive a new record to append to your dataset using only the given command.
 Step 3: Check if it's a Young City or Old City
 Scenario: Your next task is to analyze the age distribution to determine if the population is generally
 young or old.
 ● Create an Age array and examine the statistics shared in the .ipynb file.
 Step 4: Check the Country's Race Distribution
 Scenario: Understanding racial demographics is important for policy making. Your task is to analyze the
 race distribution.
 ● Create Race Arrays and make numerical identifications as shared in the .ipynb file.
 Step 5: Check if Senior Citizens Follow Work Hour Policy
 Scenario: The government has a policy that senior citizens (age > 60) should not work more than 25
 hours a week. Your job is to check if this policy is being followed.
 ● Create a Senior Citizen Array and find out using the steps in the .ipynb file.
 Step 6: Check Education and Income Relationship
 Scenario: You need to determine if higher education correlates with higher income.
 ● Create relative Arrays and find the relations as shared in the .ipynb file.
